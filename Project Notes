OBJECTIVE/SUMMARY
Using State monthly average temperatures to create SQLite database for FLASK dashboard
Data visualization to interactive plots and charts using HTML and Javascript that show trends in temperature across state and/or year.

PROJECT STEPS:

DATA / Data Cleanup:
Temperature by state by month SOURCE: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/climdiv-tmpccy-v1.0.0-20220204
Transform data designation and add COLUMN.   For example
01001021895


Element          Record
Name             Position    Element Description


STATE-CODE          1-2      STATE-CODE as indicated in State Code Table as
                             described in FILE 1.  Range of values is 01-48.


DIVISION-NUMBER     3-5      COUNTY FIPS - Range of values 001-999.


ELEMENT CODE        6-7      01 = Precipitation
                             02 = Average Temperature (currently have in REPO as of 02.12.2022)
                             25 = Heating Degree Days
                             26 = Cooling Degree Days
                             27 = Maximum Temperature (possible add?…)
                             28 = Minimum Temperature (possible add?…)
			     
YEAR                8-11     This is the year of record.  Range is 1895 to
                             current year processed.
REMOVE COUNTY by averaging state temperatures by month for respective year
Remove county data(position 3-5)
		DIVISION-NUMBER     3-5      COUNTY FIPS - Range of values 001-999.

	Data is monthly data
	Create a static table for states which will map 2 digit numeric code to state code
	Link the state stable with text file
	Create final data set and load in SQLite DB
	
	This data is only for element code ‘02’(Average Temperature)


VISUALIZATIONS:
Input 2 dates and display before and after temperature
Input Date and State and display specific weather for those values
Interactivity Easy ideas
User Select state
User Select year
Update map to show avg temp for that year
Select state
Select month
Update map show avg temp for that year
Select state
Select time period (to and from dates)
Update map to show average temp for that month for that time period for that state



DATA QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
IDEAS
Before / After specific events (industrial age, tech advances…)
Line charts comparing avg year temps
BASIC


HEAT MAP
Compare two years and display in {heat map}?
